## Hello and welcome 
### To get started follow these steps, I am assumming that you are running this on your local server:
  1. Clone/download the "movieapp" file
  2. Unzip the file and save it to your "wwww" folder
  3. Now let's configure your database, go to your phpmyadmin
  4. Import 2 databases (users and movies), you will find them on "movieapp/db" 
  5. Now go back to back to "movieapp" file and look for config.php update this file to match your database credentials. 
  6. Run "movieapp" on your browser, the website will be empty. This is because the database is empty. 
  7. To fill in your database run http://localhost/movieapp/fetch_movies_api (I am sure there is an easer and better way to do this, I am still checking it out) 
  8. Now go back to http://localhost/movieapp you should see movies now.
